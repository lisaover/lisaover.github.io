Welcome! My name is Lisa Over. I manage research data for a multifaceted study focused on the care and outcomes of traumatic injuries with the goal of updating existing standards of care. I develop reports and applications to support study administration and perform data munging tasks to make complex datasets more accessible. I focus on the needs of my clients, which include other data managers, data analysts, project managers, and study directors. I am part of a team that makes sense of data for the benefit of the public. What I do is essential to people, and the families of people, who receive better care as a result of this study.

My professional goal brings together my expertise and enthusiasm for computer programming, statistics, and math; my desire to solve problems that benefit people, organizations, or society; and my conviction to embrace challenges and life-long learning.

I bring a set of core teaching, communication, and programming skills as well as professionalism, dedication, and perseverance to everything I do. I am an enthusiastic, independent worker who values constructive criticism and welcomes opportunities to collaborate with peers. I gravitate toward intellectual challenges and am inclined to try new approaches or techniques in my work. 

Thank you for your interest in my resume and portfolio.
