Statistics generally involves the collection, description, analysis, and interpretation of data. In Business Statistics, students select and apply appropriate statistical tools and methods to answer questions, solve problems, and make informed, evidence-based decisions. Course topics include descriptive statistics (visual descriptions and summaries of the data using graphs and tables), inferential statistics (hypothesis testing using the normal, t, F, and chi-square distributions), and regression analysis (simple linear and multiple linear regression).<br/>
