In Business Statistics, students select and apply appropriate statistical tools and methods to answer questions, solve problems, and make informed, evidence-based decisions. Course topics include descriptive statistics (visual descriptions and summaries of the data using graphs and tables), inferential statistics (hypothesis testing using the normal, t, F, and chi-square distributions), and regression analysis (simple linear and multiple linear regression). Students engaged with these topics through hands-on activities, simulations, and projects.

I taught eight sections of Business Statstics 285 from fall 2016 through summer 2018. See my <a href="https://lisasteaching.github.io/DuquesneProf/business_statistics/" target="_blank">teaching portfolio</a> for sample lessons and activities.<br/>
