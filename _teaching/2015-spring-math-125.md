Fundamentals of Statistics is a survey course in exploratory data analysis and statistical inference including graphical summaries of data, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.

Students completed a research project for this course consisting of a survey or experiment. To complete the project, students gathered the appropriate data for exploratory data analysis and performed the analysis summarizing the data using the descriptive tools from the course. A formal report of the project was to be typed and submitted as if it were a scientific paper ready for presentation.
