Welcome! My name is Lisa Over, and I am a data manager for the Epidemiology Data Center at the University of Pittsburgh. Thank you for taking an interest in my work. 

My professional goal brings together my expertise and enthusiasm for computer science, statistics, and mathematics; my desire to solve problems that benefit people, organizations, or society; and my conviction to embrace challenges and to continue learning. For the past two years, I currently work in data management for the Epidemiology Data Center at the University of Pittsburgh. From 2016 to 2018, I taught Business Statistics courses as an Adjunct Professor in Duquesne's School of Business.

I bring a set of core teaching, communication, and programming skills as well as professionalism, dedication, and perseverance to everything I do. I am an enthusiastic, independent learner and worker who values constructive criticism and welcomes opportunities to collaborate with peers. I gravitate toward intellectual challenges and am prone to try new approaches or techniques in my work. Thank you for taking an interest in my resume and portfolio.
