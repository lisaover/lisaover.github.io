    <h3>Lisa Over</h3>
    <p>Welcome! My name is Lisa Over, and I am a data manager for the Epidemiology Data Center at the 
        University of Pittsburgh. Thank you for taking an interest in my work.</p>
    
    <h3>Professional Interests and Work Ethic</h3>
            <p>My professional goal brings together my expertise and enthusiasm for computer science, 
                statistics, and mathematics; my desire to solve problems that benefit people, organizations, 
                or society; and my conviction to embrace challenges and to continue learning. For the past 
                two years, I currently work in data management for the Epidemiology Data Center at the University
                of Pittsburgh. From 2016 to 2018, I taught Business Statistics courses as an Adjunct Professor in Duquesne's 
                School of Business. </p>

            <p>I bring a set of core teaching, communication, and programming skills as well as 
                professionalism, dedication, and perseverance to everything I do. I am an enthusiastic, 
                independent learner and worker who values constructive criticism and welcomes opportunities 
                to collaborate with peers. I gravitate toward intellectual challenges and am prone to try 
                new approaches or techniques in my work. Thank you for taking an interest in my resume
                and portfolio.</p>
