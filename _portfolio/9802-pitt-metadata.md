The Life During COVID-19 Metadata Schema Application Profile is an XML Schema application profile for describing a collection of internet-based media and datasets that reflect American reactions and outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic of 2019-2020.  This XML schema aims to describe collections that showcase elements of political, social, economic, and individualistic life and that consist of a diverse set of items including picture files (jpg/png), video and audio files (mp4/mp3), articles or announcements from websites (html/pdf), and datasets generated from social networking websites and downloaded from open data websites (csv). Collections described by this schema will enable future generations to witness and come to a greater understanding of the social environment during the COVID-19 pandemic.
