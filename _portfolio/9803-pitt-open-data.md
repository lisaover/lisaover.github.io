### Allegheny County 2000/2010 Census Track Relationships
The Allegheny County 2000-2010 Census Tract Relationship File shows how 2010 Census tracts in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania relate to the 2000 Census tracts. Each record (row) consists of one unique relationship between a 2000 Census tract/2010 Census tract spatial set where a spatial set is the unique area shared by the recordâ€™s 2000 and 2010 tracts. This final course project for <i>Open Data and Government</i> involved sharing the Allegheny County 2000-2010 Census Tract Relationship File on the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center website, along with documentation on how to interpret and use the file. The project files are accessile from the PittOpenData github repository or from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC) Website.
